                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>FocusFlow Lite was created to solve a simple problem: most productivity apps are too complicated. We believe that planning your day should take minutes, not hours.</p>
                
                <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
                <p>While other apps add more features, we focus on removing friction. Our goal is to help you spend less time organizing and more time doing.</p>
                
                <h2>The Team</h2>
                <p>FocusFlow Lite is developed by a small team of designers and developers who understand the importance of keeping things simple. We use our own product every day.</p>
